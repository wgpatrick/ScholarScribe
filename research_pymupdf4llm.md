# PyMuPDF4LLM Research and Implementation Plan

## Overview
We need to research and implement PyMuPDF4LLM for robust academic paper parsing. This document outlines the steps to integrate this library into our system.

## Tasks

1. **Research PyMuPDF4LLM**
   - Locate the library source/repository
   - Analyze installation requirements
   - Identify key features for academic paper parsing

2. **Setup and Integration**
   - Install the library
   - Create a test harness to verify functionality
   - Document any limitations or necessary adjustments

3. **Implementation**
   - Develop a replacement for our placeholder PDF conversion function
   - Add structure detection for:
     - Sections and headings with proper hierarchy
     - References and citations
     - Tables and figures
     - Abstract and metadata

4. **Testing**
   - Test with various academic paper formats
   - Compare output quality with our placeholder implementation
   - Document any edge cases

## Expected Deliverables
- Fully integrated PyMuPDF4LLM-based PDF parser
- Documentation on usage and limitations
- Test suite with sample academic papers

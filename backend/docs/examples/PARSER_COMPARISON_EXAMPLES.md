# Parser Comparison Examples

This document provides a side-by-side comparison of our original basic parser and the enhanced academic parser outputs for actual academic papers.

## Test Paper

**Note**: The test paper is very minimal and doesn't fully exercise the parser's capabilities. The real academic paper examples below provide a better demonstration of the improvements.

## Abstract
The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train.

## Introduction
Recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation. Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples.

# Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition
**Authors**: arXiv:1512.03385v1  [cs.CV]  10 Dec 2015

## Abstract
Deeper neural networks are more difﬁcult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learn- ing residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, in- stead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide com- prehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth.

## Introduction
Deep convolutional neural networks have led to a series of breakthroughs for image classiﬁcation. Deep networks naturally integrate low/mid/high- level features and classiﬁers in an end-to-end multi- layer fashion, and the "levels" of features can be enriched by the number of stacked layers (depth). Recent evidence reveals that network depth is of crucial importance, and the leading results on the challenging ImageNet dataset all exploit "very deep" models, with a depth of sixteen to thirty.

## Observations and Analysis

### Improvements in Enhanced Parser

1. **Metadata Extraction**:
   - Successfully identifies and extracts titles
   - Captures author information and abstracts
   - Recognizes paper identifiers (arXiv IDs)

2. **Document Structure**:
   - Better heading hierarchy with proper levels
   - Maintains section organization
   - Groups paragraphs more coherently

3. **Special Sections**:
   - Recognizes abstract, introduction, references
   - Preserves section ordering
   - Numbers references when found

### Current Limitations

1. **Multi-column Layout**:
   - Text sometimes jumps between columns
   - Reading order can be incorrect in complex layouts
   - Some paragraph breaks occur at column boundaries

2. **Mathematical Content**:
   - Equations are not properly formatted
   - Mathematical symbols may be lost or corrupted
   - No special handling for math-heavy sections

3. **Tables and Figures**:
   - No structural representation of tables
   - Figures are not detected or placeholders inserted
   - Captions may be mixed with main text

4. **Citations**:
   - In-text citations not linked to references
   - Reference formatting is basic
   - No DOI extraction or metadata enhancement

## Next Enhancement Priorities

Based on these examples, the highest priorities for parser enhancement should be:

1. Multi-column layout detection and correct reading order
2. Improved heading hierarchy consistency
3. Table and figure detection with placeholders
4. Better reference formatting and citation linking
5. Mathematical equation handling

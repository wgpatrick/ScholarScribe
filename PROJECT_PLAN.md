# ScholarScribe - Project Plan

## Project Overview

ScholarScribe is a web-based reader/notebook application for academic journal articles. It allows users to upload PDFs and instantly view both the original PDF and a structured Markdown version with the following features:

- Auto-generated outlines and short summaries
- Key term annotations with definitions
- Reference previews and summaries
- Inline user notes
- Easy sharing of read-only Markdown documents

The goal is to help researchers and students learn more quickly, especially when exploring academic papers outside their primary domain.

## Technical Architecture

1. **Backend**: Python with FastAPI, hosted on AWS Lambda (local development first)
2. **Frontend**: React with Context API for state management
3. **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM (local for development, AWS RDS for production)
4. **File Storage**: AWS S3 for PDFs (local file system during development)
5. **PDF Processing**: LlamaParse with fallback to PyMuPDF for robust academic paper parsing
6. **LLM Integration**: LlamaCloud API for document parsing and OpenAI for summaries and annotations
7. **Authentication**: Simple API key for initial MVP (no user accounts)
8. **Testing**: Pytest with focus on integration tests (70% coverage target, 90%+ for PDF conversion)
9. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with detailed logging and monitoring

### Development Approach

We've decided on a two-phase development approach:

1. **Local Development Phase**:
   - Develop the entire application locally
   - Use Docker for PostgreSQL database
   - Store files in local filesystem
   - Mock S3 interactions when needed (or use LocalStack)
   - Fast iteration cycle without deployment delays

2. **Cloud Deployment Phase**:
   - Deploy to AWS when ready for staging/production
   - Use Lambda for backend API
   - Use S3 for file storage
   - Use RDS for PostgreSQL database
   - Set up CloudFront for frontend delivery

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: PDF Upload & Structured Markdown Conversion âœ…
- âœ… Upload and store PDFs with local and S3 storage services
- âœ… Develop robust PDF-to-Structured-Markdown pipeline using LlamaParse
- âœ… Implement multi-layer fallback strategy with PyMuPDF for offline operation
- âœ… Extract structured data from academic papers (headings, paragraphs, references, figures)
- âœ… Design and implement database models with comprehensive repository layer
- âœ… Create test suite for validating repository functionality
- âœ… Implement document processor for coordinating the complete pipeline
- âœ… Create basic API endpoints for document operations
- âœ… Validate complete flow from upload to structured data storage

> **Status**: The PDF processing and backend functionality for Phase 1 are complete. We have implemented a robust pipeline with LlamaParse and fallback mechanisms. The database schema is implemented with repository patterns and comprehensive tests.

### Phase 1.5: Frontend Development ðŸ”„ (Current Focus)
- ðŸ”„ Set up React project with TypeScript
- ðŸ”„ Create document upload component
- ðŸ”„ Implement document list view
- ðŸ”„ Build document viewer with toggle between PDF and Markdown
- ðŸ”„ Add navigation for document sections
- ðŸ”„ Implement API client for backend communication
- ðŸ”„ Add user interface for viewing document structure
- ðŸ”„ Create visualization for references and figures

### Phase 2: Enhanced LLM Integration for Summaries
- âœ… Integrate with LlamaCloud API
- ðŸ”„ Generate focused summaries for each section via appropriate LLMs
- ðŸ”„ Extract key concepts from academic content
- ðŸ”„ Display structured outline with summaries

### Phase 3: Annotation System
- âœ… Design database models for annotations
- ðŸ”„ Implement repository layer for annotation operations
- ðŸ”„ Auto-detect domain-specific terms
- ðŸ”„ Generate definitions using appropriate LLMs
- ðŸ”„ Allow users to highlight text for custom definitions
- ðŸ”„ Implement UI for viewing annotations
- ðŸ”„ Create interactive popup system for annotations

### Phase 4: Reference Extraction & Metadata
- âœ… Design and implement reference models
- âœ… Parse references from the document
- ðŸ”„ Fetch metadata from external APIs (CrossRef, PubMed, etc.)
- ðŸ”„ Display reference data in side panel when clicked

### Phase 5: Sharing & Access Control
- âœ… Design database models for sharing functionality
- ðŸ”„ Implement repository layer for share links
- ðŸ”„ Generate shareable read-only links
- ðŸ”„ Restrict editing capabilities for shared viewers
- ðŸ”„ Hide PDF view for non-owners

## Key Data Models âœ…

All data models have been implemented with SQLAlchemy ORM and use UUID primary keys.

1. **Documents** âœ…
   - Basic metadata (title, authors, abstract)
   - PDF metadata (path, hash, size)
   - Processing information (status, method, time)
   - Markdown content
   - View tracking (count, last viewed)

2. **Sections** âœ…
   - Hierarchical structure with parent-child relationships
   - Heading text and level
   - Section content
   - Order within parent section
   - Metadata (word count, has_figures, has_tables, has_equations)
   - Keywords

3. **Annotations** âœ…
   - Term or text snippet
   - Definition (auto or user-requested)
   - Position markers
   - User-specific flags

4. **References** âœ…
   - Raw citation text
   - Structured metadata (title, authors, year, venue)
   - Extracted DOI and URL
   - Order within document

5. **Figures** âœ…
   - Figure type (figure, table, equation)
   - Caption
   - Reference ID (e.g., "Figure 1")
   - Image path or content (for tables)
   - Section relationship

6. **Share Links** âœ…
   - Document ID
   - Unique share key
   - Access expiration
   - View tracking

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Python + FastAPI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Storage**: AWS S3
- **AI**: LlamaCloud API + OpenAI API

# PyMuPDF4LLM Implementation Plan

## Overview

Based on our evaluation of the baseline PDF conversion implementation, we need to develop a more robust solution using PyMuPDF4LLM. This document outlines the research and implementation plan.

## Research Phase

1. **Library Investigation**:
   - Locate the PyMuPDF4LLM repository or package
   - Study available documentation and examples
   - Identify key features relevant to academic paper parsing
   - Understand limitations and requirements

2. **Alternative Approaches**:
   - If PyMuPDF4LLM is not available/suitable, consider:
     - Direct PyMuPDF with custom academic paper processing
     - Other academic paper parsing libraries
     - Building our own solution using PyMuPDF and ML techniques

3. **Academic Paper Structure Analysis**:
   - Study common academic paper formats (IEEE, ACM, etc.)
   - Identify heuristics for structure detection
   - Research ML approaches for section classification

## Implementation Strategy

### Core Components

1. **Document Structure Extractor**:
   - Extract hierarchical headings (proper H1-H6)
   - Detect paragraph boundaries and text blocks
   - Handle multi-column layouts correctly
   - Identify figures, tables, and their captions
   - Extract references and citations

2. **Academic Paper Semantics**:
   - Detect standard sections (Abstract, Introduction, etc.)
   - Link in-text citations to references
   - Extract paper metadata (title, authors, date)
   - Handle mathematical notation

3. **Post-Processing Pipeline**:
   - Clean and normalize extracted text
   - Structure the content in Markdown format
   - Add proper header hierarchy
   - Format references section
   - Insert placeholders for figures/tables

### Technical Architecture

```
PDF File → PyMuPDF Parser → Document Structure Extractor → 
Academic Semantics Processor → Markdown Formatter → Structured Markdown
```

## Evaluation Metrics

To measure the quality of our implementation, we'll track:

1. **Structural Accuracy**:
   - Heading detection rate
   - Paragraph boundary precision
   - Reference extraction accuracy

2. **Semantic Understanding**:
   - Section classification accuracy
   - Citation linking accuracy
   - Metadata extraction accuracy

3. **Performance**:
   - Processing time per page
   - Memory usage
   - Success rate across different paper formats

## Implementation Milestones

1. **Research and Setup** (1-2 days):
   - Find and integrate PyMuPDF4LLM
   - Set up development environment
   - Create test harness

2. **Basic Structure Extraction** (2-3 days):
   - Implement heading detection
   - Develop paragraph boundary detection
   - Handle basic multi-column layouts

3. **Academic Semantics** (2-3 days):
   - Implement section classification
   - Extract and format references
   - Link citations to references

4. **Post-Processing and Refinement** (1-2 days):
   - Implement Markdown formatting
   - Add figure/table placeholders
   - Clean and normalize output

5. **Testing and Evaluation** (1-2 days):
   - Test with diverse academic papers
   - Measure performance metrics
   - Refine based on evaluation results

## Fallback Strategy

If PyMuPDF4LLM is not suitable, we'll implement:

1. **Custom PyMuPDF Processing**:
   - Direct use of PyMuPDF for text extraction
   - Custom heuristics for academic paper structure
   - Rule-based section classification

2. **ML-Assisted Processing**:
   - Train a basic model for section classification
   - Use pre-trained models for entity recognition
   - Implement rule-based post-processing

## Resources Needed

1. **Libraries**:
   - PyMuPDF/PyMuPDF4LLM
   - Text processing utilities
   - Machine learning frameworks (if needed)

2. **Test Data**:
   - Diverse academic papers from different domains
   - Various formats (IEEE, ACM, preprints, etc.)
   - Papers with different layouts and structures

3. **Documentation**:
   - Academic paper format specifications
   - PyMuPDF documentation
   - Markdown specification

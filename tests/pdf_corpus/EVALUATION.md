# PDF to Markdown Conversion Evaluation

## Current Implementation Evaluation

After testing with real academic papers, here are our observations on the current baseline implementation:

### Strengths
- Successfully extracts text from PDFs
- Processing is quite fast (under 0.1 seconds per paper)
- Basic heading detection works for ALL CAPS headers
- Preserves text content for the most part

### Weaknesses
1. **Poor structure preservation**:
   - Does not maintain proper heading hierarchy (H1, H2, H3)
   - Misses many section headings that aren't in ALL CAPS
   - No paragraph structure preserved
   - Tables and figures are not handled well

2. **Format issues**:
   - Extra line breaks throughout text
   - Column text sometimes reads across columns instead of down
   - Mathematical equations are lost or corrupted
   - Reference formatting is lost

3. **No semantic understanding**:
   - Key sections (abstract, introduction, methods, results) not identified
   - References not separated out or structured
   - No citation linking
   - Figures and tables not detected

## Requirements for PyMuPDF4LLM Implementation

Based on our testing, here are the requirements for the improved implementation:

1. **Structural Requirements**:
   - Proper heading hierarchy detection (H1-H6)
   - Paragraph preservation
   - Column handling (read down columns, not across)
   - Accurate reference section detection and formatting
   - Figure and table preservation/placeholder

2. **Semantic Requirements**:
   - Identify key sections (Abstract, Introduction, Methods, etc.)
   - Recognize citations and link to references
   - Extract metadata (title, authors, date, journal)
   - Handle mathematical notation better

3. **Technical Requirements**:
   - Maintain fast processing speed
   - Handle various PDF formats and layouts
   - Graceful degradation for problematic PDFs
   - Clear error handling

## Next Steps

1. Research PyMuPDF4LLM capabilities and limitations
2. Create a custom academic paper processing pipeline:
   - Use PyMuPDF for initial text extraction
   - Apply academic paper structure heuristics
   - Implement semantic understanding layers
3. Update test metrics to measure structural accuracy
4. Expand test corpus with more diverse papers

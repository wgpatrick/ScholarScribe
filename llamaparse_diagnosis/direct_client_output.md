# 1 Introduction
Recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [13] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [35, 2, 5]. Numerous efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures [38, 24, 15]. Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional computation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains. Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduction models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms are used in conjunction with a recurrent network. In this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.

# 2 Background
The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU [16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models, the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section 3.2. Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22]. End-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-aligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks [34]. To the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-aligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].

# 3 Model Architecture
Most competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35]. Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence of continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output sequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive [10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.

of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the
query with the corresponding key.

## 3.2.1  Scaled Dot-Product Attention
We call our particular attention "Scaled Dot-Product Attention" (Figure 2). The input consists of
queries and keys of dimension \(d_k\), and values of dimension \(d_v\). We compute the dot products of the
query with all keys, divide each by \(\sqrt{d_k}\), and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the
values.

In practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together
into a matrix \(Q\). The keys and values are also packed together into matrices \(K\) and \(V\). We compute
the matrix of outputs as:

\[
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V                                 (1)
\]

The two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-
plicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor
of \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{d_k}}\). Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with
a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is
much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized
matrix multiplication code.

While for small values of \(d_k\) the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms
dot product attention without scaling for larger values of \(d_k\) [3]. We suspect that for large values of
\(d_k\), the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has
extremely small gradients. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by \(\sqrt{\frac{1}{d_k}}\).

## 3.2.2  Multi-Head Attention
Instead of performing a single attention function with \(d_{model}\)-dimensional keys, values and queries,
we found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values \(h\) times with different, learned
linear projections to \(d_k\), \(d_k\) and \(d_v\) dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of
queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding \(d_v\)-dimensional
outputs.

increased the maximum output length to input length + 300. We used a beam size of 21 and α = 0.3
for both WSJ only and the semi-supervised setting.
Our results in Table 4 show that despite the lack of task-specific tuning our model performs sur-
prisingly well, yielding better results than all previously reported models with the exception of the
Recurrent Neural Network Grammar [8].
In contrast to RNN sequence-to-sequence models [37], the Transformer outperforms the Berkeley-
Parser [29] even when training only on the WSJ training set of 40K sentences.
7   Conclusion
In this work, we presented the Transformer, the first sequence transduction model based entirely on
attention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with
multi-headed self-attention.
For translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based
on recurrent or convolutional layers.           On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014
English-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best
model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.
We are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We
plan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and
to investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs
such as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.
The code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/
